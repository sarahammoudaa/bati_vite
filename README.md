# BATIVITE

A Flutter-based app for ordering and delivering construction materials, enhanced with data-driven insights to optimize delivery performance and logistics.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application inspired by Uber Eats, tailored for the construction supply chain.

# Delivery Time Analysis: Impact of External Factors Using Data Science & AI

## Overview  
This project combines app development with a data science module that analyzes how external factors (weather, traffic, port congestion, etc.) impact delivery times on the BatiVite platform. The goal is to leverage **machine learning** and **data analytics** to predict delays, identify bottlenecks, and improve operational efficiency through data-driven decisions.

## Dataset  
The dataset integrates various delivery-related features:  
- `weather_condition_severity`  
- `port_congestion_level`  
- `shipping_costs`  
- `supplier_reliability_score`  
- `lead_time_days`  
- `route_risk_level`  
- `driver_behavior_score`  
- `delivery_time_deviation` (target variable)  

## Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing** — Cleaning and encoding raw data for model readiness.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — Visualizing patterns and correlations between factors and delivery delays.  
3. **Feature Engineering** — Creating new variables to improve model prediction power.  
4. **Machine Learning Model** — Training a **Random Forest classifier** to predict delivery delays and identify high-risk deliveries.  
5. **Model Evaluation** — Assessing model performance with accuracy and other relevant metrics.  

## Results  
- Identified weather, port congestion, and route risk as major drivers of delivery delays.  
- Developed an accurate predictive model for delivery risk classification to support proactive logistics management.

## Recommendations  
- Implement **real-time monitoring** systems to adapt routes dynamically based on weather and traffic data.  
- Enhance **driver and supplier communication** to reduce delays and improve service reliability.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python (data processing and ML)  
- Pandas (data manipulation)  
- Matplotlib (visualizations)  
- Scikit-learn (machine learning)  
- Flutter (mobile app development)
